# Accessibility {#accessibility}

We need to make sure that our Apps are accessible. If you have been adhering to the style guide, your App should be in a decent position. When you're ready to test the accessibility of your App, you'll need to deploy the App to a sever and then use the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). Enter the URL of your App in the noted box to run an evaluation. See what accessibility issues your App has and then address them.

## Testing Accessibility
We highly recommend using the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

```{r waveDescStat, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="WAVE Report for Descriptive Statistics App"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/descStatOverview.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:waveDescStat) shows the WAVE report for the Descriptive Statistics App. There are 54 errors including missing alternative text, empty headings. There are also 8 contrast errors, 14 alerts (skipping heading levels),

```{r waveOverfit, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="WAVE Report for Overfitting App"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/overfitPrereq.png")
```

While there are fewer errors for the Overfitting App (Figure \@ref(fig:waveOverfit)), there are a lot of alerts on this app including skipping heading levels and small text.

By using the `boastApp` function and adhering to this Style Guide, your App should be in a good initial position. After running your App through WAVE, we can work with you address any changes that might be necessary.
