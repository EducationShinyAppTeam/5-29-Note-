# (PART) Visual Appearance {-}

# App Layout {#layot}

This chapter of the BOAST Style Guide deals with the Visual Appearance of each app. Visual Styling encompasses not only text styling but also color scheme usage, graphics (images, plots, tables), and the dashboard layout. For each app, there are 6 major components to the Visual Appearance that you will need to consider: PSU Branding, the Dashboard, Common Elements, Color, Text Styling, and Graphics.

One of the most important benefits of using the `boastApp` function from the `boastUtils` package is that is that much of the Visual Appearance will be automatically handled for you. However, you should still familiarize yourself with the Visual Appearance Style for our apps.

## Dashboard {#dashboard}

All apps will make use of a Dashboard structure. This divides the visual appearance of each App into three main areas. 

+ Across the top of the App will be the Header 
+ Along the left side of the App will be the navigation list (the Sidebar) where the various Tabs (pages) of your App will be listed
+ The last area is the Body; this is where all content will appear.

### Color in the User Interface {#colorUI}
Within BOAST, we use color themes to help provide consistency for the elements of each app and to denote different chapters. Part of the standardization process with the Style Guide seeks to bring the many fractured color themes together into a cohesive, centrally managed set. This helps reduce the programming burden from the students, who should focus on the R side of the programming, not the CSS side.

All aspects of color in the User Interface should be controlled through the CSS file(s). This includes all of the following:

+ Dashboard coloring (Header, Sidepanel, Body)
+ Text coloring
+ Coloring of Controls (including buttons, sliders, and other input fields)

By using CSS, especially through `boastApp`, you’ll be able to ensure that there is consistent coloring throughout your App.

#### Implementing a Color Theme
To activate a color theme is a simple process, especially if you are following this Style Guide and using the `boastUtils` package. (If you are in an App using ui.R and server.R, make sure that the boast.css call is in the ui.R file.)

In your App's code, go to where you first call the function `dashboardPage`. Then, as the first argument you'll type `skin = "[theme]"` before moving on the next argument, `dashboardHeader`.

You will replace `[theme]` with one of the following: `blue`, `green`, `purple`, `yellow`, `red` or `black`. The choice will be determined by the color assigned to that chapter. This is all you have to do.

If you are unsure what color to put, use `blue` as the default.

#### The Themes
There are six color themes that we've currently made. The names of the themes are a general indication of coloring, with one exception. The `black` theme is not black but rather an aqua/teal set. The themes are typically three colors (four for `blue`) and based upon the Penn State Palettes. Non-Penn State colors will be denoted with asterisks. 

All of the themes have been checked against 8 different forms of color blindness.

##### Blue
The Blue Palette is our central palette and should be used by default. The Blue Palette looks like the following:
```{r bluePalette, fig.cap="The Blue Palette", fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=2, echo=FALSE}

### Current Chapter Color Assignments {#chapterColor}

Here are the current (05/27/2020) color theme assignments for chapters:

+ Chapter 1: Data Gathering RED
+ Chapter 2: Data Description YELLOW
+ Chapter 3: Basic Probability BLUE
+ Chapter 4: Statistical Inference PURPLE
+ Chapter 5: Probability BLUE
+ Chapter 6: Regression "BLACK"
+ Chapter 7: ANOVA "BLACK"
+ Chapter 8: Time Series PURPLE
+ Chapter 9: Sampling RED
+ Chapter 10: Categorical Data YELLOW
+ Chapter 11: Data Science GREEN
+ Chapter 12: Stochastic Processes BLUE
+ Chapter 13: Biology GREEN

## Dashboard Header
Each Dashboard Header contains only a couple of elements. The most important of these will be a [shortened] Title of your App. This will automatically be followed by the sidebar collapse/expand button. At the far right, you will then include a link to the home page of BOAST using the Home icon.  

Additional icons might be included to the left of the Home icon. However, these icons remain the same for all Tabs/pages of your App and are thus are not appropriate for Tab/page specific information.

There should not be any additional elements in the Dashboard Header. Any links for navigate in your App should appear in the Sidebar on the left edge.

The width of the Title component of the Header should be 300; `titleWidth = 300`.

## Dashboard Sidebar

### Last Element
The last element of the Sidebar will be the Penn State Logo. Please refer to the Section \@ref(logo).

## Dashboard Body

The Sidebar (responsible for App navigation) and the Body are intimately related to one another. The Sidebar provides structure to your App as well as being the primary way that a user can move around the App. The Body is where all content (text, images, plots, buttons, etc.) exists for the user to read, view, and interact with.

The Sidebar should have a width of 300, (`width = 300`).

To ensure a consistent experience across all apps, you need to make sure that your App has the following tabs/page, in the following order:

### The Overview Tab
This Tab is __REQUIRED__ for all Apps. This is the main landing page of your App and should appear at the top of the sidepanel.

The icon for this Tab must be "dashboard".

The Overview Tab must contain __ALL__ of the following elements:

1.  “Title” (as Heading 1)
2.  A description of the app (as paragraph text under the title)
3.  “Instructions” (as Heading 2)
4.  General instructions for using the App (using an Ordered List environment)
5.  A button that will take the user to the next Tab/page.
6.  “Acknowledgements” (as Heading 2)
7.  A listing of acknowledgements including, coders, content writers, etc. (as a paragraph)
8.  Last Element: `div(class = "updated", "Last Update: mm/dd/yyyy by FL.")` with mm/dd/yyyy replaced with the date of the update you pushed to the server and FL replaced with your initials.

There is no need to use boldface or colons with the section headings when you properly use Heading tags. Thus, "Instructions:" does not follow this Style Guide. Additionally, there should not be an "About" heading.
      
### A Prerequisites Tab
If your App needs to ensure that the user has the base understandings necessary to interact with your App, you’ll need to create a prerequisites Tab. Otherwise, skip this Tab.

The icon for this Tab must be "book".

Use the word "Prerequisites" rather than "Pre-reqs", "Prereqs", or "Pre-requisites". 

#### Types of Prerequisites
There are two different types of prerequisites: technical/conceptual and contextual. Both of these go into the Prerequisites tab.

Technical/Conceptual Prerequisites cover ideas that the user needs in order to fully engage with your App's statistical goal. For instance, if your App is about ANCOVA, the ideas of ANOVA and building a linear model would be good candidates for technical/conceptual prerequisites.

Contextual Prerequisites cover ideas that which are beneficial for the user to understand a context you're using. For example, if you are referencing an astragalus, you should include a brief explanation and/or picture of an astragalus. 

Keep in mind that Contextual Prerequisites are different than context which should be part of the Activity Tab. If the information is necessary to interpret sliders/graphs and is *specific*, then you should include this information in the Activity Tab. If the information helps the user say "Oh, that's what they mean by [blank]", that is good sign of something to put in the Prerequisites Tab.

#### Text Links in Prerequisites (and Beyond)
In as many instances as possible, we would like to provide the user with a link to Online Notes of a World Campus Statistics course. 

*Note: what appears here is applicable any time you want to link to an webpage that is beyond BOAST.*

The link that you provide must take the user to the appropriate location. Do not send the user to the home page for a course; rather, take them to the relevant page. To do this, you'll need to explore the [Department of Statistics STAT ONLINE](https://online.stat.psu.edu/statprogram/) page and look through the courses. 

You will create these links in-line, not as a button. Thus, they must be part of a paragraph block (i.e., inside a `p()` with other text) or as part of list item (i.e., inside a `li()`).

Your link must include descriptive text. Using "Click Here" is __not__ descriptive. Rather say where the link will take the user. If you look through the links that we've included in this Style Guide, we've been modeling this. This descriptive text not only helps all users anticipate where they are going but also improves the accessibility of the links. (Plus, have you ever tried to click a small link on your phone?)

Once you find the appropriate page, you'll need to copy the URL for your link. There are some instances where we might be able to find an existing anchor (look for two inter-locking rings to appear when you place your cursor over a title) or make a request for adding an anchor. These are especially useful if what you want to link to is only part of the page.

*Note: not all requests for anchors may be fulfilled and not all course notes have anchors.

The styling of the link will be managed by the BOAST CSS file.

Here's are two examples of how you would code a text link:
```{r textLinkEx1, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# [omitted code]
# Working in the UI section

# Example 1: in a paragraph
p("While not critical, you might wish to refresh your understanding on some of the basic shapes
  of graphs in statistics. A good resource for this would be the ", # Notice the ending space
  tags$a(
    herf = "https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat100/lesson/3/3.2#graphshapes", #the URL
    "STAT 100 Table of Graph Shapes" # the descriptive text for the link
    ),
  ". Feel free to check that resource out." 
  # Notice the ending punctuation for the prior sentence is not part of the link.
)

# Example 2: in a list item
tags$ul(
  tags$li("Review the ", # Notice the ending space
    tags$a(
      herf = "https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat100/lesson/3/3.2#graphshapes", #the URL
      "STAT 100 Table of Graph Shapes" # the descriptive text for the link
      )
    # List items don't necessarily need ending punctuation. 
    #Be consistent; either all items do or none.
  ) 
)
# [omitted code]
```


###  Activity Tab(s)
This is the heart of your App and you are required to have at least one.

In the event you have multiple activities, each one will need a separate Tab. The order of these Tabs will depend upon the your goals for the App.

Each Tab should contain all information/instructions for the user to be able to interact with the activity without having to switch to other Tabs.

The icon you use depends on the type of activity:

+ Games will use the icon "gamepad".
+ Explorations will use the icon "wpexplorer".
+ Challenges will use the icon "gears".

#### General Layout for Activity Tabs
For the vast majority of Activity Tabs, we will adopt a 3-part layout:

+ Across the top will be any general information the user needs to interact with your App as well as an context information.
+ To the left and wrapped in a well panel will be the inputs/controls that the user will need to manipulate.
+ To the right and NOT in a well panel will be the outputs (graphs, images, R output)

There will be some cases where this general layout does not necessarily work. For instance, Tic-Tac-Toe games will not follow this layout. 


### References
The last Tab will be for your references. This Tab is __REQUIRED__ and is where you will place a reference list for all of the following items that you used in your app:

+ All `R` packages you used
+ Sources of any Code you used directly or drew heavily upon from other people
+ Pictures and/or other images
+ Data sets
+ Refer to the Documentation Section (\@ref(documentation)) of this Style Guide for more information.
      
The icon for this Tab must be "leanpub".

### Tabs Inside the Body
There are two types of tabs in a Shiny app: there are the `tabItem` (i.e., the pages within an app and should appear in the Sidebar) and `tabPanel` (i.e., creating sub-pages or independent sections). In this section, we will discuss this later case.

Deciding on whether to use `tabPanel` is going to depend on several things:

1. Do you have two or more aspects that are related enough that they shouldn't be their own separate tabs/pages of your App?  
    a. If NO, then you shouldn't use `tabPanel`.  
    b. If YES, then continue.
2. Are any of your aspects something that would be better suited as a Challenge or Game tab?  
    a. If YES, move that aspect to a separate page. If you still have 2+ aspects, continue.  
    b. If NO, continue.  
3. Are the aspects independent enough that a person can skip a couple and still use the App successfully?  
    a. If NO, then you should re-consider your design.  
    b. If YES, then proceed with using `tabPanel` in you design.

When you go to make a set of tab panels you will need to first create a `tabsetPanel` which will wrap around all of the individual panels. Use `type = "tabs"`.

The tabs inside the body should automatically appear horizontally and along the top of the tab body (i.e., in the white space below the Dashboard Header). Any visual styling will be managed by the BOAST CSS file at a global level.

## Common Elements
In addition to the Dashboard elements of the apps, there are other elements that are common. This include things such as how inputs should be ordered, buttons, correct/incorrect indicators, and animation buttons.

For information about popovers, rollovers, hover text, or tooltips, please see Section \@ref(popovers).

### Ordering Inputs
One of the most powerful aspects of Shiny apps is that the user interacts with them. Thus, we do need to consider not only the ways in which user interact (e.g., buttons, sliders, text entry, etc.) but also the order in which you want the user to manipulate the inputs. Coming up with a single declaration for how to order inputs in all cases is not necessarily feasible. However, we can set up a general guideline for how to make decisions on ordering your inputs.

Please use the following guidelines for determining the order of inputs in the User Interface (UI):

1. In general, if you want your user to do things in certain order, make your inputs appear in that order.  For example, If you want them to pick a data set, then an unusualness threshold/significance level, what attribute to test, and then set a parameter value, then your inputs should appear in that order.
2. Make use of how we read the English language, i.e., Top-to-Bottom and Left-to-Right to provide an implicit ordering for your user.
3. If a user needs to carry out steps in particular sequence for your App to run properly, then place your inputs inside of an Ordered List environment with explicit text on what they should do. For example,  
    1. Choose your data set: [dropdown]  
    2. Set your unusualness threshold/significance level  
       [slider]  
    3. Which attribute do you want to test: [dropdown]  
    4. What parameter value do you want to use: [numeric input]
4. If an input is going to reset other inputs you should either:  
    a. Warn the user before hand  
    b. Move the input to the top of the list  
    c. Program the input to not reset other inputs  
    d. Some combination of the above  
5. If the inputs are not dynamically linked to the output (e.g., plots automatically update with a change in the input's value), then you should include a button that says "Make Plot" at the end of the inputs.
   
### Buttons {#buttons}
Buttons are one way in which users interact with the apps. The two most common functions that are used are `shiny::actionButton` and `shinyBS::bsButton`. Both functions share many of the same features. Two ways in which they are different is that `shinyBS::bsButton` has an additional `style` argument while `shiny::actionButton` has a `width` argument that gives you fine grain size control (`bsButton` just has a qualitative size option).  There are three key styling aspects: shape/animation, color, and text & icon.

#### Shape/Animation
All shape aspects of buttons will be controlled by CSS. The standard shape will be rectangular (the default). Sizing will be controlled by CSS although setting `size = "large"` for the `bsButton` call may be done.

We have a number of apps where a button will change shape/size when a person hovers their cursor over it. This "animation" is to be discontinued. This is to say that buttons which change shape/size should be flagged as issues and resolved at the first opportunity.

At most, the button's color might change (e.g., lighten or darken), depending on the context.

#### Color

The coloring of the button will also be controlled by CSS in one of two ways.

The default way will be through the BOAST CSS. This will ensure that the selected color scheme for your App will be consistent.

The second way only applies to `bsButton` and the `style` argument. Here, this option references an external CSS file beyond BOAST. We see these most often in games. Use the following list to guide you in choosing which style:

+ `warning`: Good for when you want the user to proceed with caution; for example a submit button in a game.
+ `danger`: Good for when you want the user to think twice before clicking; for example, a reset game button.
+ `success`: Good for when you want to convey that the user can proceed safely; for example, a button that advances the user through the game
+ `info`: Good for when you want to give some additional information; for example, a button that triggers game instructions popping up, a button that gives a hint, or a button that might filter a question pool.

When in doubt, use the the `default` style option (or even omit this argument) for `bsButton` or use `actionButton`.

#### Text & Icon
The last styling element of a button is two-fold: the text that is in the button and the icon. 

Here are some guidelines for text of a button:

+ All buttons must have some text. 
+ Generally speaking, the text should be relatively brief and clear. 
  - Don't use "Go to the next page" when you could use "Next"
+ The text should make sense with the action of the button; for example,
  - "Reset" if the button resets something (a game, a plot, inputs)
  - "Submit" if the button triggers the app to grab and process input values
  - "Make Graph" if button causes a graph to be generated
  - "Show/Hide Graph" if a button makes a graph object appear/disappear
  - "Next" if a button moves the user along some path.
+ If the button references something like a particular tab (prerequisites, exploration, etc.), the text should reflect this.
  - "Explore!" for a button that takes a user to an Exploration tab.
  - "Prerequisites" for a button that takes a user to a Prerequisites tab.
  - "Challenge Yourself!" for a button takes a user to a Challenge tab.
  - "Play!" for a button that takes a user to Game tab.
+ If a button references an object like an activity packet or a download prompt the text should refer to that
  - "Activity Packet" for a button that would open up and/or download a packet for the user
  - "Download Data" for a button that would download a data file.
+ Clarity is essential. If there are multiple buttons on the page, make sure that you use clear text for what button does and/or references.

Here are guidelines for the inclusion of icons in a button:

+ Game buttons will NOT have any icons.
+ Direction Buttons (e.g., "Next" or "Previous") will NOT have any icons. Rather make the button text "<< Previous" or "Next >>"
+ A "Prerequisites" button will use the "book" icon
+ All other tab buttons (labels ending with "!") will use the "bolt" icon.
+ A download button will use the "cloud-download" icon.

### Correct/Incorrect Marks
In games, you can give the user a visual cue as to whether they are correct or incorrect through the use of two images:

```{r marks, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Correct/Incorrect Marks", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/check.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/cross.png")

```

You can save these two images by right-clicking on them and selecting "Save Image As...". You will need to put them in the `www` folder/directory of your App.

Their placement in your App will depend upon what makes the most sense.

### Animation Buttons
One feature of slider inputs is the option to include a Play/Pause button that allows the user to create an animation of your plot. Enabling this option can be quite useful if allowing the user to move through the whole set of slider values is desirable. 

To enable this, you'll need to make use of the `animate` argument:

```{r animateEx1, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#[code omitted]
sliderInput(
  inputId = "mtcAlpha",
  label = "Set your threshold level, \\(\\alpha_{UT}\\):",
  min = 0.01,
  max = 0.25,
  value = 0.1,
  step = 0.01,
  animate = animationOptions(
    interval = 1000, loop = TRUE))

#[code omitted]

```

You can set `animate=TRUE`, `animate=FALSE` or invoke the `animationOptions` function as we've done in the example and recommend. This will force you to make some important decisions: namely, how long the slider should wait between each movement (`interval`, in milliseconds) and should the animation start over once the slider reaches the maximum (`loop`). 

The `interval` is going to the most challenging value to figure out. This timer *__ignores__* everything else; that is, it doesn't wait to see whether your plot has updated. Remember, the more complicated the process is that generates your plot, the longer your App will need to render the plot. Thus, you can quickly get into a case where the slider has advanced several times while your App is still trying to render the first update. While `renderCachePlot` can help speed things up, keep in mind that you still might need to play around with the `interval` value to ensure smooth functionality.  

Make sure when you're testing an animated slider to vary all of the parameters involved in the graph. This will help ensure that you test adequately.

The styling of the play/pause button will be controlled by the BOAST CSS file.

### Progress Bar

Consider adding a loading bar to show the process for intense computations; this will help the user understand that your App is processing and not frozen/broken.
