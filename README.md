- Matching game by input the letter
- First tab --> Prerequisite page-- (providing information on statistics)
- Second tab --> About pages: a) about statement b) instruction c) acknowledgement --> bold, colon  
- Hint: question mark on the upper left of each page 
- Feedback --> given according to the user's input 
- Loading bar to show the process of large number calculation (not needed) 
- Using header on the top for different levels game
