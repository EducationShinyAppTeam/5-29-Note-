# Style Guide

This guide spells out the styling that should be used for all apps included in BOAST. Styling refers to several different aspects including:
- How you approaching writing code
- Visual appearance of the app
- The wording used in the app
- Documentation of references, including code and data sources

By following this style guide you'll ensure that any app you create will meet our standards.

## boastUtils Package
By using the [boastUtils](https://github.com/EducationShinyAppTeam/boastUtils), you'll be able to automate much of the visual appearance styling. This will reduce the amount of work you'll need to do and worry about. We **strongly** recommend that you make use of this tool.

Please check out the package's [page](https://github.com/EducationShinyAppTeam/boastUtils) for instructions on installing and using this toolkit.

## Writing Code
Ultimately, when you write your app's code, you should adhere to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). However, here are some additional practices you should follow.

1. Leave Comments
    (a). At bare minimum, use a comment to break your code into sections. These can also provide others with potential keywords to search for when looking at your code later on.
    (b). For particularly complex sections, use comments to summarize what you're trying to do.
2. Use informative names for variables and functions

## Additional Tools
- [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) - Checks adherence to a given style, syntax errors, and possible semantic issues.
- [styler](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/) - Format R code according to a style guide.

### Apps
- Format the page using the consistant color
- Check potential for mobile friendly --> narrow the window (black block at the bottom?)
- Matching game by input the letter
- First tab --> Prerequisite page-- (providing information on statistics)
- Second tab --> About pages: a) about statement b) instruction c) acknowledgement --> bold, colon  
- Hint: question mark on the upper left of each page 
- Feedback --> given according to the user's input 
- Loading bar to show the process of large number calculation (not needed) 
- Using header on the top for different levels game
- Using bsToolTip for silderbar pop over hint, since the regular bsPopover will matach the color code of sider bar 
- Frame around the question of challenges 
- use "i" to open up a short pargraph for instruction; use "?" to open up a hint
- Put PennState logo on the About page, link to Stat department or school website. Use the square logo!
