Approaching your App’s construction in a systematic way will help you tremendously. The following suggested workflow is an abbreviated version of the one in Section 1.4: Read the Style Guide Identify a topic Sketch out your plans Create a new repository on GitHub Begin writing the code Edit and locally Test your code Push your code to GitHub/Create a dev branch Push your edits Larger scale testing Pull Request Additional tweaks This workflow (both in the more expanded state and in the abbreviated one) leaves out a lot of the going-ons and decision making that goes into making an app. Our goal with this section is to walk you through this process as Neil makes an app from scratch. 9.1 Step 1: Read the Style Guide This is step is critical to making an app that is easy to debug (vital when programming) and is in-alignment with the Standards that we have set for BOAST. Please take your time going through the Style Guide and keep an eye on it for updates. You can access the published Bookdown version by clicking on the address link located at the top of the Guide’s GitHub Repository. As you build your App, we recommend periodically checking the Style Guide to 1) ensure that you’re still adhering to it, 2) to stay up-to-date with the Guide, and 3) to see (and then use) any useful code chunks that are listed. Even as the authors of this Guide, we’re constantly looking things up. Thus, there is no shame in constantly referring to the Style Guide; after all, it is meant to be a Go-To Reference. 9.2 Step 2: Identify a Topic This is one of the more challenging tasks for anyone: deciding what to make an app about. The notion of “picking a topic” is a bit misleading as not only should you pick a topic, but you also need to pick the purpose of the app, and the goals. While all three go hand-in-hand with each other, the easiest decision of the three is purpose. 9.2.1 Your App’s Purpose When we look across BOAST, we can categorize the apps into two major classes: apps whose purpose is to help students learn an idea/concept and apps whose purpose is to help students review an idea/concept. The NHST Caveats App stands as a good example of an app whose purpose is to help students learn something. On the other hand, the [Null] Hypothesis Testing Game (Tic-tac-toe) and the Matching Distributions are examples where the student is reviewing their understandings. There are some apps such as ANCOVA that are dual purpose, having both learning elements and reviewing elements. Generally speaking, apps whose purpose is learning are going have Explorations and possibly Challenges for Activity Tabs. Apps whose purpose is reviewing will have just Games for Activity Tab(s). By identifying early on the purpose of your App, you’ll be able to better plan your app. 9.2.2 The Topic Here is where you’ll decide what statistical idea/concept your App is going to be centered around. While you should be as specific as possible here, apps for learning need to have much more specificity than apps for reviewing. Saying that you want your App “to deal with probability” is not going to be as useful as saying that you want your App “to help students recognize when probability is and is not appropriate for different contexts”. Don’t feel like you have to details to the nanoscale. As you continue developing and talking with people, you’ll start adding in more details. You can identify potential topics through any of the following: Think of a concept in a Stat class that you (or your peers) struggled with (or still do) Think of a concept where you thought to yourself “I wish there was a way to visualize this” Think of a concept where you went “How does this work?” Did you see/hear about a new study and thought to yourself “what’s going on?” Did a media report make you do a double take? Ever think to yourself “I wish I had more practice with [topic].” And more Again, this list is just a starting place to identify potential topics. Draw inspiration from your experiences, your curiosity. Bounce ideas off of each other and the faculty. Word of Caution #1: While it is okay to get ideas from other websites, please keep track of this. We need to give credit where credit is due. If you come across an app (whether in Shiny or some other program) somewhere and you think that it would be good to translate that into Shiny app for BOAST, we need to know. Word of Caution #2: An unproductive place to begin is to say “Hey, I want to make a memory game” or “I saw this really cool animation and I want to make an app that does that.” Both of these (especially the second) place the educational aspect of the app as a secondary focus. This is not consistent with BOAST. All apps should place educational purposes and goals before anything else. Forcing a topic to make use of certain tool because that tool would be “cool” or “fun” does not further our goals. We should strive for synergy between topics and the tools within Shiny. 9.2.3 Goals Now, we’re sure that some people have already thought to themselves “hey, you’ve already had us identify purpose so isn’t this the same?” To which we reply “No.” We’ve used purpose to refer an overarching aim of your App. Here, goal refers to a much more contextualized aspect. While these goals will be less important for reviewing apps, you will need to identify specific learning goals for learning apps. For this step, you’re going to need to work with the faculty to identify the learning goals for your app. If you’re drawing from a past experience in a course, look to see if there were learning objectives listed. Those can be extremely useful starting places. 9.2.4 Example The following is a somewhat stream-of-consciousness narrative of how Neil tackled this step. We’ll place flags in parentheses. I would like to make an app that would help introductory students (identifies an intended audience) wrestling with some of the concepts of descriptive/incisive statistics (Purpose: learning). Some ideas that I have are: Conceptualizing the two distinct uses of the sample arithmetic mean–mitigation of measurement errors of a single object vs. measuring how well a group of objects/beings performs Conceptualizing statistics as functions that measure attributes of collections Conceptualizing the relationship between the values of the sample median and sample arithmetic mean is not a competition (i.e., one is not “better than” the other) Avoid falling into the skewness trap for the ordering of the values of the sample median and sample arithmetic mean. This last option feels like a fairly straightforward (and simple) app to create. Additionally, there’s an article by von Hippel on this issue I can reference. (Topic: relationship between the values of sample median and sample arithmetic mean in the presence of skewness) After using the app, a student should recognize that while for a many data collections that have skewness, the value of the sample arithmetic mean will be either greater (for positive skew) or less (for negative skew) than the value of the sample median, this is not an absolute rule. (Learning Goal) 9.3 Step 3: Sketch out plans Something to keep in mind with this workflow is that it is not strictly linear. That is, just because you have moved into Step 3, doesn’t mean that you can’t go back to Step 2 and make revisions. Additionally, as you get into Steps 5-8, you might find yourself coming back to Step 3 (and possibly Step 2) and making changes. This said, sketching out your plans will help you as you move forward with developing. There are several things that you’ll want to be sure that you include in your sketch: A Suggested Title This might not be what you settle on, but you’ll need to have this firmed up by the time you get to Step 4. You’ll want to have both a [Long/Formal] Name and a shortened name ready Goal(s) of the App Carry this forward from Step 2 as a tangible reminder If you have several goals, you might consider denoting which tabs go with which goals What will the user be doing Thinking about what you want the user to do Identify anything the user might click on, drag, or otherwise manipulate. If there are going to be options, identify what those options should be. Will there be different levels? Will there be a Challenge tab? What will the user experience Think about the general layout (explore, game, etc.) What outputs should the user be examining What are the relationships between elements Think about how each input impacts the outputs If you want the user to have a certain experience, does the coding allow for that experience to happen? Other Elements Are you going to reference any external images? Are you going to import any data files? If so, which ones? Do you have them? Is there an activity packet? The format of your sketches is up to you. 9.3.1 Example As I start thinking about what this app might look like, I’m going to use a sheet of paper in quarters to organize some thoughts. Figure 9.1 shows the entire sheet of paper. The quadrants move left to right, top to bottom. Figure 9.1: Picture of My Plan In the first quadrant (Figure 9.2), I’ve listed a title (“Skewness’s Impact on the Values of the Sample Median and Sample Arithmetic Mean”), a possible short title (“Skew, Med, SAM”) as well as a restatement of my goal. I’ve then listed general aspects about the layout of my app, including what skin/theme color (yellow) I would need to use. I’ve additionally identified that I need to include the von Hippel article in my Reference Tab as well as locating a version of the General Social Survey (GSS). Figure 9.2: First Quadrant: General Information The second quadrant of my paper is the Overview Tab sketch (Figure 9.3. I don’t have much information here. Figure 9.3: Second Quadrant: Overview Tab Figure 9.4: Third Quadrant: Exploration Tab The next quadrant (Figure 9.4) is where I started detailing the first Activity Tab of my app: the first Exploration. I’m imagining that in this exploration that the user would look through a variety of cases where the “rule” does and does not work. What I want the user to walk away from this tab is that just because a histogram looks positively skewed does not imply that the value of the sample arithmetic mean is greater than the value of the sample median. I’m imagining a drop-down menu that would allow the user to move through a variety of data sets. Ideally, these data sets would be real data. The General Social Survey, has a variety of attributes that we could use, include several that demonstrate what I want. For example, the number of adults (18+ y.o.) living in a household is positively skewed but the value of the sample median is larger than than the value of the sample arithmetic mean. Which each choice of the user makes, the histogram on the right will update to show the appropriate data, plus reference lines for the values of the two statistics. I might want to add a numerical display as well. I also want there to be some context helping the user to understand each choice. I’ve left as an open question whether to enable a user to import/create their own data set on this tab. I’m currently leaning towards not allowing this. Additionally, I’ve marked something for a punchline but this will need more thought. Figure 9.5: Fourth Quadrant: Challenge Tab The fourth and final quadrant (Figure 9.5) is an idea I’m still kicking around. This would depend on the specific audience and course goals for which users would go here. My idea is to extend the goal for the app to allow students to construct an understanding for what conditions might lead to \\(Sample\\;Median\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)&lt;SAM\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)\\), \\(Sample\\;Median\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)=SAM\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)\\), and \\(Sample\\;Median\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)&gt;SAM\\left(\\mathcal{X}\\right)\\). At this moment, I’m leaning towards marking the Challenge Tab as being a future improvement/addition rather than being part of the initial version of the app. 9.3.2 Share Your Plan Once you have a sketch, you’ll want to share this plan with others to get ideas for suggestions, modifications, etc. Different people might be able to point you to code snippets you can reuse from other apps. More importantly, they might be able to help you think about things that you glossed over/missed and/or thought about but didn’t articulate. By sharing these plans, we’ll make better apps. This is also the point in time in which the faculty will say whether you can go ahead and move to Step 4. 9.4 Step 4: Create Repository Here you’ll want to reference Section 2.5 on GitHub Repo Naming. Most app [full] titles don’t make good Repo Names. This is where the potential short title comes into play. You’ll need to make sure that there isn’t already a repository that has that name. When you get a name figured out for the repository, you can go ahead and create the repo. Make sure to set Git Ignore to R. 9.5 Steps 5-8: Write, Edit, Test, Debug We recommend starting with a copy of the Sample App as the basis. This will give you a good skeleton to use for your new app. (Still under construction) 9.6 Step 9: Larger Scale Testing (Still under construction) 9.7 Steps 10-11: Pull Requestion and Tweaks (Still under construction) "]
