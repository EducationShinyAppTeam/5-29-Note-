DataCamp GitHub EducationShinyAppTeam BOAST in Microsoft Teams (tied to your PSU AccessID) Ensure that you have all of the proper software. R (version 3.5.* minimum, version 4.0.0 preferred) [Download] RStudio Desktop(most current version preferred) [Download] Additional Software that we recommend GitHub Desktop [Download] R Packages–here are some basic packages that everyone will need; be sure to install their dependencies too: install.packages(c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;shinyBS&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;)) A copy of the Sample App (see below) 1.2 boastUtils Package Bob created the boastUtils package to automate much of the design and development process. This will not only reduce the amount of work you’ll need to do, it’ll also make apps more consistent. Starting Summer 2020, you will be required to you make use of this tool. Please check out the package’s page for instructions on installing and usage. library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&quot;EducationShinyAppTeam/boastUtils&quot;) 1.3 Sample App Bob and Neil have created a Sample App repository that you can use as a template for your own apps. To get started, clone the Sample_App template repo found on GitHub. This will provide you with a skeleton for organizing your files as well as your code. There are several methods you can use: Direct Download (Basic) GitHub Desktop (Recommended) Command Line (Advanced) 1.3.1 Direct Download You can download this repository directly by visiting: https://github.com/EducationShinyAppTeam/Sample_App/archive/master.zip 1.3.2 GitHub Desktop If you are using GitHub Desktop and have linked your account that has access to the EducationShinyAppTeam repository, you can do the following from inside GitHub Desktop: Bring up the Clone Repository Menu (File -&gt; Clone Repository…) Enter Sample_App in the search bar and select the option that says Sample_App (not sampleapp) Click the Choose… button for the local path (this is where you want to the clone to live on your computer) Click the Clone button. See also: GitHub Desktop Help 1.3.3 Command Line Enter the following command in your terminal: git clone git@github.com:EducationShinyAppTeam/Sample_App.git See also: Git Handbook Resources to learn Git Happy Git and GitHub for the userR 1.4 Workflow As you work on apps, both updating existing and developing new ones, moving through a workflow can help you organize yourself. 1.4.1 Revising/Updating Existing Apps Read the Style Guide Explore the existing apps in the book When you identify an app you wish to work on, Go to that app’s repository in GitHub Create new issues on GitHub to log both bugs and suggestions for improvements Create an issue specifically if the App currently does not abide by this Style Guide Optional–assign yourself to the issue Download the current version of the app by using either RStudio or GitHub Desktop. Create a new branch for your developments. Begin editing the code As you edit, be sure to reference this Style Guide and test your code locally via Run App in RStudio. Periodically push your edits to your development branch. Don’t forget to add commit messages and reference any issues. When you’re ready to do larger scale testing you’ll need to publish your App to the TLT RStudio Connect server (See Section 1.5). When you’ve reached a point where you’ve finished editing, push your most recent commit to your development branch and then create a Pull Request. Assign Neil as a reviewer. Make any requested changes and re-push to your development branch. Update the Pull Request with a new comment. If everything checks out, then we’ll merge your development branch with the master branch and schedule formal deployment of your App. 1.4.2 Creating New Apps Read the Style Guide Identify a topic for your new App Sketch out your plans for the App. This should occur BEFORE you start coding. Be sure that you include: Suggested Title Goal of the app What will the user be doing (i.e., potential inputs) What will the user be experiencing (i.e., potential outputs) Relationships between various elements. When your plan gets approval, create a new repository on GitHub (See Section 2.5); you can initially load the Sample App template to this repository, if you wish. Begin writing the code As you edit, be sure to reference this Style Guide and test your code locally via Run App in RStudio. When you get the basic structure of your App set up, push your code to GitHub and create a new development branch for your continued editing. You can open new issues on your app as you go. Periodically push your edits to your development branch. Don’t forget to add commit messages and reference any issues. When you’re ready to do larger scale testing you’ll need to publish your App to the TLT RStudio Connect server (See Section 1.5). When you’ve reached a point where you’ve finished editing, push your most recent commit to your development branch and then create a Pull Request. Assign Neil as a reviewer. Make any requested changes and re-push to your development branch. Update the Pull Request with a new comment. If everything checks out, then we’ll merge your development branch with the master branch and schedule formal deployment of your App. 1.5 Testing Your App To test your App beyond your local machine, we will be making use of TLT’s RStudio Connect platform. You will need to following these directions. 1.5.1 Set Up/Login to the VPN Please refer to the following PSU Knowledge Basis Articles: VPN for Mac OS VPN for Windows VPN for Apple iOS VPN for Android You MUST be logged into the PSU VPN to both upload and test your App on each device. 1.5.2 Connecting Your RStudio to TLT’s RStudio Connect You only need to do this step once. After you’ve logged into the PSU VPN, go to TLT’s RStudio Connect and log in using your PSU ID. Once logged in, click on the Publish button Figure 1.1: Click the Publish Button Select Shiny App and a pop up window will appear. Follow the steps in this window (especially Step 4) to set up the connection. 1.5.2.1 Checking You’ve Connected You can check to see if you’ve connected by going into RStudio’s Options and looking at the Publishing tab. You should see a similar entry as what is in the green box below: Figure 1.2: Check Your Publishing Profile 1.5.3 Publishing Your App for Testing Make sure that you are connected to PSU’s VPN and that you’ve already connected your RStudio to TLT’s server. Click on the Publishing Icon, located just to the right of the Run App button. Be sure to select the TLT Server. 1.5.4 Configuring for Testing Once your App has been published, a new window should open in your browser that shows your App plus the optional controls. Figure 1.3: Successful Publish and Settings In Figure 1.3, you will need to change a setting to enable others (people and devices) to test your app. Click on the Access tab and set Who can view this application to Anyone-no login required. (These are highlighted in the green boxes.) Keep in mind that all users/devices MUST first connect to the PSU VPN to access your app. If you want, you can add collaborators as I did in the example (orange box). This is not required. The most important piece is the Content URL (marked with the blue star). You’ll need to copy this URL and give that URL out to your testers. This will allow them easily access your app, regardless of the type of device they are using. 1.5.5 Check the Logs As you test your App, you’ll want to look for any error messages and/or warnings that get generated. Click on the Logs tab (red box in Figure 1.3) to view. 1.5.6 Problems? If you run into problem either publishing your App or getting the App to launch on the TLT, please reach out to Neil and Bob. "]
