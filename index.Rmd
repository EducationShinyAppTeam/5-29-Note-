# Welcome

This guide spells out the styling that should be used for all apps included in [BOAST](https://github.com/EducationShinyAppTeam/BOAST). Keep in mind that there are several different aspects to what makes up Style including:

  - Coding (how you write, organize, and comment the code that makes the app)
  - Visual Appearance (how you make the app look including tabs, fonts, colors, icons, etc.)
  - Wording (how you write information, instructions, and other messages to the users)
  - Documentation (how you provide references, including code and data sources, and give credit)

By following this style guide youâ€™ll ensure that any app you create will
meet our standards.
